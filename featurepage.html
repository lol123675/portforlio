    <h1>Cheeraleading</h1>
    <h3 class="featurepage">Cheering for the Grand street campus wolves is one of my many hobbies. Cheering is challenging but also fun I have many cheer sisters and have been to alot of competions. My last competion was in Orlando flordia Nationals it was a breath taking experence and it was fun cause we also got to go to universal studios. We went on many rides and it was great we got third place out of the whole countury. Before nationals it was regionals and we won first place and this year we will win first place and I cant wait !!.</h3> <p>
